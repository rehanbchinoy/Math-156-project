# Final project for Math 156 (Machine Learning) at UCLA.

Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's blog post, "The Unreasonable
Effectiveness of Neural Networks", my team trained a
character-based RNN
model to simulate the works of classic literature, including
Homer's _The Odyssey_, and James Joyce's _Ulysses_.
You can find example snippets of output text in the
final report.

In addition to training the model, we 
modified key parameters of the model and evaluated the effect 
on the quality of the generated text. The modified
parameters include
batch size, epoch size, activation function,
and layer architecture.
